# Primum Take-home

This project is my solution for the [Interactive Comments Section](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-comments-section-iG1RugEG9) on Frontend Mentor. It is a monorepo created with pnpm and Turborepo.

## Prerequisites

- This monorepo uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/).

- Web integration tests run on Playwright. Playwright browsers must be installed with the command:

  ```
  pnpx playwright install
  ```
